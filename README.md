## Setting Up A Development Environment
You can use [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) to easily set up a development environment. <br>
When you clone the repository and open the folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it will notify you to reopen the project in a container. <br>
However you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed to use [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/).

If you prefer a more traditional way to setup a development environment, you can manually install [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/).


## Building The Project
You can run the command below to build the project.
```sh
scarb build
```
